      first: "In 2014, Margaret Hagan introduced the term Legal Design to give a name and theorize the set of design practices applied in the Legal field. Today, when we talk about Legal Design, we are talking about all the projects and initiatives at the crossroads of the Design and Law disciplines (as we can talk about Medical Design for instance)."
      second: "As a reminder, Design formalizes services and products by questioning individuals about how they experience their environment (spaces, things, websites, posters…). On the other hand, Legal rules the relationships between entities and people (laws, contracts, terms). The convergence between these two disciplines invites legal services or products designers to place legal services users at the center of their thinking and to question their legal experience (perception, interactions, actions, feelings, interpretations…), the aim is to adapt and rethink legal services or product for those who use them. Therefore, Legal Design gives rise to new processes, interfaces, or visualization for examples."
      third: "Law wants to define the responsibilities and to protect, so, many “end users” wants to limit their experience of law to the minimum because if we live this experience, that means that we get involve into a problem. The current experience of the law has certain characteristics such as the perception of the subject as boring or complex, the lack of understanding of technical terms, the habit of accepting something without reading it (the T&Cs scroll for example), the fear of doing something wrong, etc... This should create a real mutual understanding (on the legal professionals and designers sides) of the added-value of involving designers in legal delivery to respond to common issues as accessibility, intelligibility, trust, or transparency for example. From the collaboration between Designers and Legal professionals, but also engineers, developers, project managers and so on, new uses and experiences of law emerge to meet the current stakes."
      fourth: "The main goal of Legal Design is to restore the right to its true strategic and its performative functions in society."
