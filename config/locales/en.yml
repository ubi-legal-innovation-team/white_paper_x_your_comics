    vision_para: "We want with this white paper to contribute to a collective endeavor, to put forward initiatives from everywhere that inspired us, and in the end to foster a community of sharing of practices, and not to define THE legal design method or rules or THE examples to copy/paste. Because we think this ecosystem needs competition and diversity, but not wall gardens and gatekeeping."

    definition_para:
      first: "In 2014, Margaret Hagan introduced the term Legal Design to give a name and theorize the set of design practices applied in the Legal field. Today, when we talk about Legal Design, we are talking about all the projects and initiatives at the crossroads of the Design and Law disciplines (as we can talk about Medical Design for instance)."
      second: "As a reminder, Design formalizes services and products by questioning individuals about how they experience their environment (spaces, things, websites, posters…). On the other hand, Legal rules the relationships between entities and people (laws, contracts, terms). The convergence between these two disciplines invites legal services or products designers to place legal services users at the center of their thinking and to question their legal experience (perception, interactions, actions, feelings, interpretations…), the aim is to adapt and rethink legal services or product for those who use them. Therefore, Legal Design gives rise to new processes, interfaces, or visualization for examples."
      third: "Law wants to define the responsibilities and to protect, so, many “end users” wants to limit their experience of law to the minimum because if we live this experience, that means that we get involve into a problem. The current experience of the law has certain characteristics such as the perception of the subject as boring or complex, the lack of understanding of technical terms, the habit of accepting something without reading it (the T&Cs scroll for example), the fear of doing something wrong, etc... This should create a real mutual understanding (on the legal professionals and designers sides) of the added-value of involving designers in legal delivery to respond to common issues as accessibility, intelligibility, trust, or transparency for example. From the collaboration between Designers and Legal professionals, but also engineers, developers, project managers and so on, new uses and experiences of law emerge to meet the current stakes."
      fourth: "The main goal of Legal Design is to restore the right to its true strategic and its performative functions in society."

    issue_1:
      header: "Issue 1 : Informational Legal Design"
      span_1: "Law, beyond words ? Think about the Legal mediation."
      para_1: "Designing Legal information means thinking about its content and format for its users to reach them and meet their need(s). There are still too many legal contents that aren’t designed, at first, for their users, for those who read and use them. They are blocks of technical and jargonous texts which fail in their real function, beyond only protecting the legal professional in a court in case of litigation. Legal Design is thus to be equipped with a new panel of expressions means (diagrams, infographics, plain language…) to make law understandable and accessible. But it is above all to establish user-centric methodologies (tests, interviews, prototyping…) to design a content, a format and a life cycle (distribution, communication, archiving) that will be adapted to users and their behaviors. Therefore, Legal Design can’t be reduced to a simple visual input, it’s a whole strategy to implement."
      para_2: "''<i>Legal Design is often referred as mostly the visual part of it. But in fact it's a change in the way we communicate and practice law.</i>'' Lieke Beelen - Founder of Visual Contract."
    issue_2:
      header: "Issue 2 : Access to law (A2J)"
      span_1: "Restore the Law to its function."
      para_1: "One of the driving stakes of Legal Design is to make law accessible to all, whatever the documents, laws or approaches context. Originally, the law is the set of rules of living together that govern our society. But the rules are not obvious by their only content. It subsists a clarity problem in the texts and especially a lack of transparency and visibility on legal procedures. Being aware and understanding the rights, the steps to follow or finding support require constant rethinking. To do so, we must strive to deeply understand the Legal user’s journey, agents as much as citizens, companies as much as consumers and think of all the steps or support their encounter. Legal Design is also a systemic approach, from the informational design to the journey and tools creations until the services reorganization to finally be able to create a Legal experience which makes sense for every one of us."
      para_2: "''<i>A user-centered way of practicing law to make legal documents and processes accessible, actionable and engaging. Very strong democratic and societal stake.</i>'' Marie Potel Saville - CEO at Amurabi"
    issue_3:
      header: "Issue 3 : Innovate sustainably"
      span_1: "Destabilize and experiment new practices."
      para_1: "Legal Innovation involve rethinking practices to meet today’s tomorrow’s needs. It is questioning its own habits and their possible evolutions in order to produce ever more efficient and meaningful legal services and products. Redesigning documents or tools is often only the tip of the iceberg of Legal Design. If we want to offer a more performative legal experience to these users,it’s often necessary to fundamentally rethink the services offered and so the way to design law, work practice, business model.(It is often necessary to fundamentally rethink the services offered and thus the ways of conceiving the law, the work practices, the economic model that produce them.).Innovating can sometimes destabilize a company if not introduced properly and thus Legal Design must be facilitated by acculturation to innovation and working on legal professionals culture and mindset as much as on deliverables. This can be done by the support from innovation experts, the sharing of experiences, interdisciplinarity, promotion of new skills or creation of new positions."
      para_2: "''<i>Design is not just about solving problems, it's about innovating and criticizing the existing.</i>'' Ariana Rossi - Postdoctoral researcher at SnT"
    issue_4:
      header: "Issue 4 : Implement legal design"
      span_1: "Learn legal design step by step."
      para_1: "The education and awareness of Legal Design is often discussed since it is an emerging practice, exercised in heterogeneous structures (from the law firm to the government ...) by multidisciplinary teams. Today, there are no comprehensive courses that combine strong bases of design and law principles. This is mainly learned by practice, incrementally, through working groups, short trainings or workshops conducted mostly by specialized agencies. From this lack of knowledge, there is a need to raise awareness, to demonstrate the return on investment of legal design. There are now more think thanks, labs, associations and soon even a journal are set up to learn how to design legal services and products. Legal professionals and designers are also trying to think of legal design in an academic way in law curriculum to make this practice more accessible and build the legal professions of tomorrow."
      para_2: "« <i> Legal design is Building a new set of professional pathways and opportunities for people who (...) find that the traditional ways of law students and lawyers do not allow them to bring about the positive changes in society that prompted them to get into the law. </i>» Margaret Hagan, Law By Design, 2016"
    issue_5:
      header: "Issue 5 : Perception of law professionals"
      span_1: "Lawyers are not blockers of projects from their ivory towers."
      para_1: "The value proposition of a legal department is clear: assess risks, avoid sanctions (especially financial) and protect a reputation. However, there are no measures to demonstrate and assess this concretely (fir example in widely-recognized KPIs). Even if the legal departments can be perceived as essential, protective, structuring, there is still some way to go to break this image of “blockers” and more deeply of the law as constraining and boring for any project. Legal Design must therefore demonstrate the added value of a legal department for an organization. Through its interdisciplinary aspect or the forms legal design takes, it can support lawyers as real partners who adapt to their clients and not the other way around. Legal design thus communicates another perception of law and its experts."
      para_2: "Quote Edhec : ''<i>Some believe that lawyers sometimes remain locked in their 'ivory tower'.</i>''"
    issue_6:
      header: "Issue 6 : Deals with a multiplicity of outcomes"
      span_1: "Create the unknown / Fall in love with the problem."
      para_1: "Along with legal design, also emerges or re-emerges legal techs, legal operations and legal communication strategies. Intrinsically, they are the driving forces behind the transformation of the law. Indeed, legal design, through its user-centered research stages, can pinpoint issues that will be resolved both by the creation of a user-friendly document or a website and by the implementation of process, policies, reorganization, or the purchase and deployment of a technology. However, it may be tempting to directly seek the solution that will make the work of lawyers more fluid without understanding the problem and the context. We equate legal techs or legal ops with purposes and not means. It is necessary to accept and make accept that for any project of legal design, the result will depend on the research. Doing legal design means explaining an approach, raising awareness of a certain project management, gaining trust? "

        header: "_Legal and the designer"
        para_1: "Legal Design as a discipline has developed considerably in recent months, in the corporate world as in our everyday life. The main face of that development is the Legal designer."
        para_2: "In 2021 you don't need a state exam to be a Legal Designer. Former lawyers are Legal Designer, companies are recruiting Legal designers graduated from design school. Will this be the same in 2030? The future is uncertain but the reconciliation of the two paths of Law and Design was achieved through training, in academics works but also - as often in design, through projects, some of which are presented on this website."
      second_block:
        header: "_First seeds of Legal Design training."
        para_1: "But where to train? Lieke Beelen's Legal Design Lab is giving us a first answer to this question:  maybe at TU Delft | Industrial Design Engineering, where the leading Dutch legal design professionals in education and practice came together?"
        para_2: "The Dutch Legal Design Lab has carried out all kinds of (research) projects for a fairer society and has brought together design students, law students, educational / academic institutions and public and commercial organizations to tackle the problems occurring when creating an access to justice project. This allowed a close collaboration between research and concrete project, between public and private which will directly affect social lives in the Netherlands but also international business."
        para_3: "In France <a href='https://www.globalinstitute.legal/' target='_blanck' class='text-blue'>Global Institute for Law & Innovation</a> ed by Laura Fauqueur is a young startup created in 2019, specializing in the innovative production of academic content (Certificates, DU, Research projects, Publications, Conferences) which focus on disruptive technologies (LegalTech, Blockchain, IA, Data Science etc.) and whose value proposition is as follows: rethink, train and innovate."
        para_4: "Bringing together public and private talents in innovative technologies, this young Institute trains (University Diploma LegalTech, University Diploma Scientific Data Management in 2021. 1st University Diploma in Legal Design in Europe in 2022) students from all over the world and connects research and business to invent the legal professions of tomorrow. A lawyer school in Paris also integrated Legal Design as one of the axes of its « <a href='https://www.linkedin.com/company/lab-efb/', target='_blanck', class='text-blue'>lab</a> »."
        para_5: "An industrial design University, a French training start-up, University Diploma, these training programs foreshadow a variety of institutions that can accommodate the teaching of Legal and Design together. Will this variety spread? Are we going to see law schools offering design modules? And what about  management and business schools, economics faculties? And of course, will design schools integrate this as a worthy opportunity for their students to transform life through law? I hope so and the future will tell, but it is the success of the former that will motivate the latter."
      third_block:
        header: "_The trainers of Legal Design"
        para_1: "The trainers for Legal and Design are already showing an interesting variety of profiles. Communication professionals, current or former lawyers, industrial designers, information designers, product designers. This is the sign of a discipline that welcomes bold people that have desires to make a change and also to make business in a new market."
        para_2: "This variety helps because of the multidisciplinary aspect of Legal Design. Everyone brings their expertise, vision, knowledge. It also creates great differences in the content and outcomes of these trainings, which sometimes lead to an excessive fragmentation of legal design practices."
        para_3: "It seems obvious but two profiles are mandatory in the training of Legal Design: Designers and Lawyers. The Designer approach allow the never ending questioning, the ability to test, to prototype, to create and create again without fear of failing because you can adapt to your user. The absence of a trained designer in any Legal Design training should be avoided as it deprive students of the essential process of rethinking the status quo, something all designer know (or are supposed to know) how to do. The standard shall be set for the future : no legal design without some professionally trained designer somewhere in the process, as an actor, as a trainer."
      fourth_block:
        header: "_The effects of Legal Design on Law and Design community"
        para_1: "Project management has been used in Law for big, complex projects that included for example transnational regulations and teams. But adding design principles to legal projects brings under the spotlights not only the question of regulations but also of the citizen, of how this regulation is understood, applied. Design has an effect on access to justice and the Lexia lab project in south America is a good example of that."
        para_2: "Design also influences the legal counsel and his role. The link between law and strategy has been proven as law can help to take decision that will impact the business. Design with its user centric approach has also a link with strategy. Examples of companies that have placed design at the core of their strategy are numerous. Why not imagine a law firm, a legal  department of  big company for example, that would position this function at the same level?"
        para_3: "Legal Design also helps the lawyer to put everything in perspective: their users, the role of law, the strategic position they have with other actors (internal partners, …). These questions are or almost always asked in Legal Design and this put the legal counsels in a strategist, project manager role by design."
      fifth_block:
        header: "_Some new challenges"
        para_1: "This strategy and project management role is not really about numbers  numbers. The future relations between Legal design and Legal Operation roles therefore needs to be addressed, (not answered for now, as legal operations are almost as “work in progress” as legal design as a business practice!). According to the Corporate Legal Operations Consortium (CLOC) legal operations is all the responsibilities of a legal department that aren’t law itself. It can be budget management, efficiency and productivity, communication, knowledge management, vendor management, technology, change management and data analysis (<a href='https://cloc.org/', target='_blanck', class='text-blue'>https://cloc.org/</a>)."
        para_2: "Such a definition would obviously include Design but we have not seen this inclusion yet, with a focus on numbers, KPIs, tech. This is normal as in-house legal must also prove that they create value and are not just cost centers. But in the future, will we continue this focus on numbers for Legal Operations? Will design and legal operations be more associated as for example is the case in Ubisoft legal team, where innovation, design and legal operations are in the mandate of the same team? This association would actually be a great one as design is sometimes consider away from financial and cost issues. But as we consider design as a strategy tool, it should be assessed as a potential driving force for innovation, costs reduction and promoting added value."
        para_3: "Legal innovation, technologies, operations, design do not have to be dissociated but on the contrary associated and merged to created 360 legal services."
      sixth_block:
        header: "_The business of Legal design"
        para_1: "Legal Design is growing, fast and strong. Looking back at 2017 we can see a shift in how big law firms and legal departments approach the topic. Where will we be in 2025 ? In 2051 ?"
        para_2: "As a community we must ask ourselves the above questions that will shape the business of Legal Design. Hoping to have an active role in this, Ubisoft, a leading digital experience company has created a legal innovation team that put design at the core of nearly each of its activities. We want to share experiences and good practices learned in an innovative industry such as video games. These lessons can be valuable in other businesses and one of the important ones are to always listen to the players, innovate to survive, challenge ourselves and the status quo."
        para_3: "Although competition is also present, the Legal Design has also shown a tremendous will to collaborate, join forces. This should continue as more and more legal departments, companies, freelances, young professionals wish to enter the business and bring their different views, backgrounds, mindsets and make us all question ourselves, as all Legal designers are supposed to do 😊"
